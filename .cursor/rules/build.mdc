- [ ] **Close Port 8080**  
   close the port 8080 before building make sure to understand the OS before running commands.
   - NEVER CLOSE THE BROWSER FORCEFULLY
   - IF IT DOES NOT WORK WITH SIMPLE COMMAND PASS

- [ ] **Read build summary**
  - Read the build summary log in /build/reports folder 

- [ ] **Next.js 13+ Best Practices**  
  List the top five coding best practices for Next.js 13+ when implementing this design.  
  If fewer than five distinct practices apply, ensure at minimum:  
  - [ ] All variables are explicitly declared and used.  
  - [ ] No use of `any`—always specify precise variable types.


- [ ] **Build Project**  
  Run `npm run build`, capturing exit code, stdout, and stderr.

- [ ] **Auto-Fix Build Loop**  
  If the build fails or logs “WARNING”/“ERROR”, diagnose, apply fixes, then repeat **Build Project**  step and **Auto-Fix Build Loop**  until the build succeeds cleanly.

  - [ ] **Check for Warnings**
     - run  `npm run lint` with the most stric flags possible
     - take the list output and Auto-Fix all warning in loop 

- [ ] **Ensure no Errors or Warning left**

- [ ] **Ensure No Side Effects**  
  After a clean build, suggest minimal tests or type-checks to confirm no regressions.

- [ ] **Create a build summary**
  - When finish successfully to build create a report and append the report to /build/reports folder

   - Exact water coverage via CDF
   - Solves for sea level that achieves target percentage
   - Handles edge cases (0%, 100%)
   - **Impact:** User requests "15% water" ‚Üí gets exactly 15% ¬±0.1%

4. **Slope Calculation** (`src/slope.js`)
   - Central difference method for accurate slopes
   - Suitability masks for tree placement
   - Aspect calculation for future biome work
   - **Impact:** Trees never on steep slopes or cliffs

5. **Elevation Curves** (`src/elevationCurve.js`)
   - 7 designer presets (Terraced RTS, Rolling Hills, Sharp Alps, etc.)
   - Piecewise linear curves (artist-friendly)
   - Replaces hardcoded terrain flattening
   - **Impact:** Easy terrain style changes without code modifications

6. **Tree Placement v1.1** (`src/treePlacement.js`)

## üí° Key Discoveries

### **Discovery 1: Simulation Heights vs Visual Quantization**
**Problem:** v1.0 mixed simulation precision with visual style  
**Solution:** Elevation stored as Float32Array in meters, quantization applied only during rendering  
**Lesson:** Separate data precision from visual representation

### **Discovery 2: Constraint-Driven > Parameter-Driven**
**Problem:** "sea level 0.35" is abstract, actual water % varied wildly  
**Solution:** User specifies "15% water", system solves for required sea level  
**Lesson:** Design APIs around user intent, not internal parameters

### **Discovery 3: Independence Requires Multi-Stream RNG**
**Problem:** Single RNG caused cascade effects (changing trees affected lakes)  
**Solution:** Hash-based sub-seeds for independent streams  
**Lesson:** True independence requires isolated random sources

### **Discovery 4: Poisson > Grid for Natural Placement**
**Problem:** Grid-based placement created visible patterns  
**Solution:** Poisson disk sampling with min spacing  
**Lesson:** Industry standard exists for a reason (Unreal, Unity use this)

### **Discovery 5: Validation is Essential**
**Problem:** Silent failures, unexpected behavior  
**Solution:** Invariant checks, metrics tracking, console logging  
**Lesson:** Always validate assumptions, don't trust "it should work"

### **Discovery 6: Color-Based Placement is Unreliable**
**Problem:** Sampling terrain vertex colors for tree placement had edge cases  
**Solution:** Height + slope constraints from elevation data directly  
**Lesson:** Use source data, not derived visuals for logic

## üìä Performance Insights

### **Pixel Ratio = 2x the Pixels**
- Discovered renderer was using `devicePixelRatio` (2.0 on retina)
- Forcing to 1.0 halved pixel count
- **Result:** Smooth 60 FPS on rotation/zoom, minimal visual degradation

### **Poisson Disk is Fast**
- O(n) with grid acceleration
- 128x128 map, 150 trees: ~5-10ms
- **Bottleneck:** Tree validation, not generation

### **Instanced Meshes = Performance Win**
- 1 draw call per tree type (trunk/crown) vs hundreds
- Supports thousands of trees with minimal overhead

## üêõ Bug Discoveries & Fixes

### **Bug 1: Height Clamping Flattened Lakes**
**Location:** `renderer.js:313` (old)  
**Code:** `if (h < sea) h = sea;`  
**Impact:** All water bodies became flat at sea level  
**Fix:** Removed clamping, let terrain go below sea level  
**Lesson:** Be careful with "helpful" clamps

### **Bug 2: Trees in Water Despite Validation**
**Root Cause:** Using color-based checks instead of height  
**Fix:** Height-based detection (`h <= seaLevel`)  
**Lesson:** Visual properties (color) are unreliable for logic

### **Bug 3: 0% Water Covered in Water**
**Root Cause:** Noise naturally created low areas below sea level  
**Fix:** Explicitly raise all terrain above sea level when WATER_PERCENTAGE = 0  
**Lesson:** Handle edge cases explicitly, don't rely on "unlikely"

### **Bug 4: Water Plane Z-Fighting**
**Root Cause:** Separate water plane at exact sea level  
**Fix:** Removed plane, use terrain vertex colors for water  
**Lesson:** Coplanar geometry always has issues

### **Bug 5: Laggy Rotation Despite High FPS**
**Root Cause:** High pixel ratio, inefficient event handling  
**Fix:** Force pixelRatio=1, optimize mouse handling  
**Lesson:** FPS counter doesn't tell whole story (pixel fill rate matters)
